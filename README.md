# Concurrent Systems and Operating Systems
A repository containing 3 practical exercises demonstrate the use of concurrency to accelerate the performance of computer programs.

### Practical 1 - Sum of Hellos
A simple exercise to observe how Unix threads (pthreads) complete tasks concurrently.

### Practical 2 - Producer/Consumer
A producer-consumer problem which requires Mutex variables and Condition variables to be implemented to allow for correct results to be produced, while maintaining some level of concurrency.

### Practical 3
To be completed.
